# Rowspan Examples

Use `[r2]`, `[r3]`, etc. to make cells span multiple rows. Use `_` as a placeholder in subsequent rows.

import { ListTable } from '@site/src/components/ListTable';

## Simple Rowspan

<ListTable headerRows={1} caption="Products with Categories">
- - Category
  - Product
  - Price
- - [r2] Electronics
  - Laptop
  - $999
- - _
  - Mouse
  - $29
- - [r2] Books
  - Fiction Novel
  - $15
- - _
  - Technical Manual
  - $45
</ListTable>

<ListTable headerRows={1} caption="Products with Categories">
- - Category
  - Product
  - Price
- - [r2] Electronics
  - Laptop
  - $999
- - _
  - Mouse
  - $29
- - [r2] Books
  - Fiction Novel
  - $15
- - _
  - Technical Manual
  - $45
</ListTable>
```

**Key Points:**
- `[r2]` in the "Electronics" cell makes it span 2 rows
- The second row uses `_` as a placeholder for the Category column
- The cell content is "Electronics" (without the `[r2]` prefix in the output)

## Multiple Rowspans

Multiple columns can have rowspans independently:

<ListTable headerRows={1} caption="Team Schedule">
- - Team
  - Member
  - Task
  - Hours
- - [r3] Frontend
  - Alice
  - [r2] UI Components
  - 8
- - _
  - Bob
  - _
  - 6
- - _
  - Carol
  - Testing
  - 4
- - [r2] Backend
  - Dave
  - API Development
  - 10
- - _
  - Eve
  - Database
  - 8
</ListTable>
